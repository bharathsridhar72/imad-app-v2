               In Calculus II, students defined the integral  b
                a f (x) dx over a finite interval [a, b].
                The function f was assumed to be continuous, or at least bounded, otherwise
                the integral was not guaranteed to exist. Assuming an antiderivative of f could
                be found,  b
                a f (x) dx always existed, and was a number. In this section, we
                investigate what happens when these conditions are not met.
