           In Calculus II, students defined the integral  b
            a f (x) dx over a finite interval [a, b].
            The function f was assumed to be continuous, or at least bounded, otherwise
            the integral was not guaranteed to exist. Assuming an antiderivative of f could
            be found,  b
            a f (x) dx always existed, and was a number. In this section, we
            investigate what happens when these conditions are not met.
